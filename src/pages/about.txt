I am an IT professional who loves to program. I have made this page to dedicate to my many small projects that I work on in my free time, these include games, software, and tools. I am fluent in many language and love taking the hard route. There are many hobbies I enjoy ouside of programming that I may talk about here too, including Book binding, Bowling, Papercraft, Doodling, and Sewing.
