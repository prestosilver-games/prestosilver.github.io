I am an IT professional who loves to program. I have made this page to dedicate to my many small projects that I work on in my free time, these include games, software, and tools. I am fluent in writing in Zig, Nim, Python, Html, CSS, C, Rust, C#, Cpp, x86asm, z80asm, Markdown, GDScript, and Slam. I also have experience in Forth, Javascript, GLSL, Ruby, Lua and TS. I plan to learn Haskell, and GoLang, Cobol (mabye), in the future. There are many hobbies I enjoy ouside of programming that I may talk about here too, including Book binding, Bowling, Papercraft, Doodling, and Sewing.
