## About

Super early release for a game Ive been working on, download the latest release to test. The zips labeled latest are prototypes of the new engine, so they are also not complete.

## Motivation

Mainly I made this game to prove to my self I can make a game in nim.

## Goal

This will be a clockwork based cyclic game without the cycles, Instead you will be able to go back in time and redo sections of the run. If you get a faster time the time save will be removed from your final time.
