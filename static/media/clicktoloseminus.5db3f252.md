## About

Click to Lose Minus was a full remake of my [first game](ctl-1), It was designed to be less grindy.

## Wait is this a sequel

No, this is not a sequel, its mostly a rewrite to allow me to add more features in the future. There are notably some changes to help remove the grind that people noticed in the original version. There will also cross platform releases.
