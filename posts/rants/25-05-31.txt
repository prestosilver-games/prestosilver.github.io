%title: Sandeee and zig interfaces
%date: 2025 05/31

looking back at it the archectecture of sandeee really shows I was still learning zig
There are just so many things in it that you dont do even tho zig can do them, like a multi-composition relationship for example, which while yes its in uml is not a pattern anyone uses and if you use it your making it with other stuff, really weird system.

multi composition is something like saying "type A, has a part that is either B, C, or D", not something you use much

its much better to just think of it as a composition of an interface "type A, has a part that has the ability to do P", and then implement "B can do P", "C can do P", "D can do P"
And since thats easier to wrap your head around thats whats notated in docs and implemented.
