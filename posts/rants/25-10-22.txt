%title: SandEEE, game or not?

Lately while working on sandeee Ive been having a bit of trouble with direction.
I think ive resolved that all now, but really I was just having trouble deciding if I wanted sandeee to be a game, or a thing.
Long story short, I decided leaning into it being a fantasy console for a fantasy world will hit a niche that isnt hit.
Though I do worry that it may make some things hard to make satisfying lore wise.
