Multi item sorters looked cheap as heck in 1.21 but now they're even cheaper with the copper golems lmao, still a tad annoying but cheaper
The design in my survival world that I don't use had like 150 hoppers but now that the redstone is smaller you can probably cut that pretty far
Even the current storage I use could be made faster bc I don't have to use the minecart anymore
