Omg, have you seen laika, I think I've sent clips here but it's actually crazy good, At this point I feel like I just have really low standards bc I've enjoyed my past few games I've played so much lmao
The coolest thing in it to me is the diagetic music system
Like you have a cassette player that you listen to while exploring that plays your playlist, but when your in tense areas or bosses you don't use it, so it plays a set ambience track. The music is pretty much completely in world and I just really like that
