I never really thought about it before but interfaces in zig can be kinda bad sometimes.
Because the way you make the naive interface most people make in zig its normally reverse ownership, for example IWindow owns the object that implements it.
Vs in like cpp or rust its normally the correct way (the object implementing IWindow owns the interface it has with IWindow).
Kinda an interesting side effect of having no builtin interfaces, like yea you can add an interface to an object but then you cant have a running collection of the interfaces unless you are storing a running array of pointers to the interface, which is likely a pain though ive never tried it.
