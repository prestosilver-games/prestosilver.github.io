bungy cord grappling hook is problaby one of my favorite platform mechanics ive seen ngl

Later: This games controls took a really long time to get used to
I can see why it says keyboard mouse reccomended

Later: This game is crazy hard, so much to keep track of
I think it's just BC enemies do so much damage, and there are literally no healing upgrades and like a 3 HP heal that costs literally half of my mana bar feels like nothing
