Chesker is a chess engine, with pieces from other board games. I plan to expand the game to include more games.
The culmination of as many board games as I could fit into 1 game as possible.
Chesker seemed like a good first project for the new game engine I have been working hangover

%head: Current Included games
- Chess
- Checkers

%head: Other Features
- P2P multiplayer
- an AI that can play with any custom piece you add
- fully customizable boards and pieces
- more on the way!
