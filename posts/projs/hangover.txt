%date: 2022 08/23

Hangover is a game engine based on gin. The primary goals of hangover were:
- Hangover will use OpenGL for graphics.
- Hangover will have consistent naming.
- Hangover will have an UI system.

%head: Install
%code: shell
$ nimble install hangover
%end: code

%head: Usage
Like Gin, Hangover introduces a template, called "Game" which can be used as a game loop.

%head: Minimal Example
%code: nim
import hangover

Game:
  var
    bg: Color = newColor(0, 0, 0)

  proc drawLoading(percent: float32, loadStatus: string, ctx: GraphicsContext) =
    ## renders the loading screen
    ## only updates when setPc or setStatus is called in Initialize
    clearBuffer(ctx, bg)

  proc Initialize(ctx: var GraphicsContext) =
    ## load content files
    discard

  proc Update(deltaTime: float)
    ## process a frame event
    discard

  proc Draw(ctx: var GraphicsContext) =
    ## draws a frame
    clearBuffer(ctx, bg)

  proc closeGame() =
    ## called when the game is closed
    discard
