          I always find it funny when people act like a GC is really slow, it's actually only a notable performance hit if your using cyclic types or trying to mitigate fragmentation, because of the way objects are stored in gced mem most of the time deleting a variable is tipically just a subtraction, unless it's 0 then it deletes it's children
          <br/>
          Really what is typically bad about a GC is that it can't run on a thread due to it being a memory thing hence its a pause the world structure which is what's actually bad
          <br/>
          Even cycle checking is such a well studied process that it's not horribly expensive
          <br/>
          And you could copy nim and bake cycle checking into destructors, completely skipping it for all acyclic types
          <br/>
          Tldr garbage collectors are actually super fast, they are just not thread safe
