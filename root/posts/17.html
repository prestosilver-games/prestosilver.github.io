          looking back at it the archectecture of sandeee really shows I was still learning zig
          <br/>
          There are just so many things in it that you dont do even tho zig can do them, like a multi-composition relationship for example, which while yes its in uml is not a pattern anyone uses and if you use it your making it with other stuff, really weird system.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          multi composition is something like saying "type A, has a part that is either B, C, or D", not something you use much
          <br/>
          <br/>
          its much better to just think of it as a composition of an interface "type A, has a part that has the ability to do P", and then implement "B can do P", "C can do P", "D can do P"
          <br/>
          And since thats easier to wrap your head around thats whats notated in docs and implemented.
