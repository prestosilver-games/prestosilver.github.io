          I recently had a friend ask me to get some cloud rendering for a now debunked project of theirs. I took it way to far and this is the result.

          My first prototype for this was made in unity, I just drew up a small gradient circle and billboarded ~700 sprites. This turned out to be way to slow so I moved to rust because I wanted to learn rust.

        <div class="block-content">
          I decided to start with rust by writing a simple library to render stuff. Learn opengl Rust Helped with the basics alot. Once I had that done, I just had to convert the unity billboarding to a geom shader. That got me to this point.
