          I never really thought about it before but interfaces in zig can be kinda bad sometimes.
          <br/>
          Because the way you make the naive interface most people make in zig its normally reverse ownership, for example IWindow owns the object that implements it.
          <br/>
          Vs in like cpp or rust its normally the correct way (the object implementing IWindow owns the interface it has with IWindow).
          <br/>
          Kinda an interesting side effect of having no builtin interfaces, like yea you can add an interface to an object but then you cant have a running collection of the interfaces unless you are storing a running array of pointers to the interface, which is likely a pain though ive never tried it.
