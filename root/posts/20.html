          Omg, have you seen laika, I think I've sent clips here but it's actually crazy good, At this point I feel like I just have really low standards bc I've enjoyed my past few games I've played so much lmao

          The coolest thing in it to me is the diagetic music system
          <br/>
          Like you have a cassette player that you listen to while exploring that plays your playlist, but when your in tense areas or bosses you don't use it, so it plays a set ambience track. The music is pretty much completely in world and I just really like that
